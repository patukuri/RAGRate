RAGRate is a comprehensive automated evaluation framework designed to assess the performance
of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, which combine language models with external
knowledge retrieval capabilities. RAG models have gained significant traction in recent years, as they
enable language models to leverage external information sources, leading to more reliable and
factual responses.
